      My Story

    </h2>
    <div class="container second-sec">
      <div class="about-left">
        <p>
          My journey into infant sleep support began when my own baby refused to sleep longer than 45 minutes at a
          stretch. Like many parents, I tried everything—rocking, feeding to sleep, even desperate drives at midnight.
          The worst advice I received? "Just let your baby cry it out."
          That didn’t sit right with me. <br />
          I dove into sleep science, trained under leading pediatric sleep experts, and discovered gentle, no-tears
          methods that actually work. The transformation in my baby—and my own mental health—was life-changing. <br />
          That’s when I decided to become a Certified Baby Sleep Trainer, helping families just like yours. Today, I’ve
          guided thousands of parents across India—from Mumbai to small towns—through their sleep struggles.

Finally at 6 months we were able to get him to sleep through the night thanks to this program. I appreciate the support and assurance this program provided because I knew it was going to be hard for me, but I’m so glad I stuck with it. "

Monica educated us and was so patient with all of our questions and concerns. From the first night we stuck to her instruction and our family dynamics changed instantly, our baby was sleeping 8 hours a night plus taking two naps daily for 1-2 hours each.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What is baby sleep coaching?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Baby sleep coaching is a gentle, structured method that teaches babies
        how to fall asleep independently and stay asleep through the night. As
        a Certified Baby Sleep Trainer and trusted Baby Sleep Expert, I create
        personalized, no-cry sleep plans tailored to each baby’s unique needs.
        My goal is to help both babies and parents sleep better—without guilt
        or confusion.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        Why can’t a baby sleep properly during the night?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        There are many reasons—overtiredness, overstimulation, poor sleep
        routines, or even growth-related sleep regressions. Most babies wake
        frequently because they haven’t yet learned how to connect sleep
        cycles. That’s where a Pediatric Sleep Specialist comes in—to gently
        guide your baby toward deeper, more consistent sleep with
        evidence-based strategies and emotional support.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        How can you put a baby to sleep in 30 seconds?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Realistically, no healthy method can consistently put a baby to sleep
        in 30 seconds—but there are calming techniques that help babies settle
        faster over time. With proper routines, soothing cues, and infant
        sleep support, many babies fall asleep more easily. I help parents
        develop these systems based on what works for their baby’s age,
        temperament, and daily rhythm.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        What’s the best miracle method to make a baby sleep?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        There’s no one-size-fits-all “miracle,” but there is a proven path:
        gentle, consistent sleep habits. As a baby sleep expert, I don’t
        believe in quick fixes—I believe in sustainable routines that support
        your baby’s emotional and physical well-being. My approach combines
        science, empathy, and experience to create results that feel like
        magic.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        Will my baby sleep through the night without sleep training?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Some babies eventually do, but many continue to struggle for months or
        even years without support. Sleep training—especially when guided by a
        Certified Baby Sleep Trainer—can help you and your baby get better
        rest much sooner, using gentle methods that feel natural and
        respectful. Most families I work with see progress in as little as 2–3
        weeks.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        Do babies really need 4 hours of nap time during the day?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Nap needs vary by age, but yes—most babies under 12 months need at
        least 3–4 hours of total daytime sleep. Skipping naps can lead to
        overtiredness and night wakings. As a Pediatric Sleep Specialist, I
        help parents create age-appropriate nap routines that support healthy
        night sleep and overall development.
