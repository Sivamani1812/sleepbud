    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        What method did you use to sleep train your baby?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        At Sleep Bud Sleep, I use a gentle sleep training approach that
        avoids harsh methods like "cry it out." Instead, I combine
        emotional comfort with gradual sleep shaping tailored to your
        baby’s age and temperament. Every plan is created after a
        one-on-one baby sleep consultation, allowing parents to feel
        confident and supported. These methods are praised in many of our
        gentle sleep training reviews, especially by families who want
        connection and results.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        What's the best way to sleep train a 4-year-old?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Even at age 4, it’s never too late to build healthy sleep habits.
        The best method is to use a gentle, consistent routine paired with
        positive reinforcement. I work with parents to build trust, reduce
        bedtime battles, and encourage independence. As a trusted baby
        sleep coach in India, I’ve helped many families with preschoolers
        through our online baby sleep trainer services, especially those
        struggling with fears or frequent night waking.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        My 18-month-old toddler still needs me at night. How can I help
        without using cry-it-out methods?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        You’re not alone—this is very common. The good news is, gentle
        sleep training allows you to support your toddler emotionally
        while slowly guiding them toward independent sleep. Through small,
        loving changes, I help you reduce night wakings without forcing
        separation or tears. Many parents share success stories in our
        gentle sleep training reviews, showing that results are possible
        without distress—for both parent and child.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What is gentle sleep training?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Gentle sleep training is a method that helps babies and toddlers
        sleep independently without harsh or abrupt techniques. It avoids
        full-on crying and instead focuses on gradual comfort,
        predictability, and connection. Whether through online baby sleep
        trainer sessions or in-person support, I work closely with parents
        to make the process respectful and nurturing.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        Does gentle sleep training involve crying?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Mild protest is natural when routines change, but gentle sleep
        training does not involve leaving your baby to cry alone. I guide
        families through calm, emotionally responsive strategies that
        reduce tears and increase confidence. Many parents have shared in
        their gentle sleep training reviews that their babies adjusted
        quickly—with minimal tears and plenty of smiles in the morning.
